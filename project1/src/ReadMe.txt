Structure of the different files

- implementations.py : Contains the different ML functions required in the project

- utils.py : Contains useful functions but not directly related to 
	     implementations.py functions (i.e standardize() function)

- cross-validation.py : Contains the cross-validation function
- run.py: Executable that outputs our predictions in a CSV file. It is using the method that
	  provides us the best accuracy.

- Main.ipynb: It's our main jupyter notebook that allowed us to run the different 
		cross-validations for each method aswell as tuning the different parameters.
